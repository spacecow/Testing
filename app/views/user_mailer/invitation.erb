You are invited to join the beta!

I need some feedback for the system I am creating.
So far, you can only register for events.
Feel free to play around as much as you want with
the functions that are provided. When the system
does open for the public, it will first go through
a reset and delete all your doings. Do not worry
about leaving traces. Instead, abuse the system as
much as you want and provide me with valuable
information of things that are/were good and stuff
that does not work/break.  

Please, feel free to comment, question or criticize
anything on the site, that includes strange Japanese
that I would be more than glad to get corrected.
