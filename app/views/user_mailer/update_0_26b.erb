Just a small upgrade.

* Confirm
---------
You now either confirm or decline a class. Teachers that have
not yet responded appear with a questionmark (?) next to their
name at that specific class in the class schedule.
Teachers that have confirmed their classes appear with an
ok-mark (O) and teachers that have declined their classes
appear with a not-ok-mark (X) for each of those classes.

* Klasses
---------
A teacher history is saved for each class. If you change teacher
for a class, the previous teacher's status (not responded/confirmed/
declined) is saved and will appear again if you switch back to
that teacher.
