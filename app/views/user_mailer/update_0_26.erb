* Template Class
-------------------------
The template classes works as a basis for the regular classes.
If you model a typical monday with template classes, whenever
the system has to create classes for a coming monday, it will
use the template classes as a basic model for how a typical
monday will look like.

* Classes
---------
Students can reserve classes and teachers can confirm classes
that has been set up by admin. Teacher confirmation can also
be done manually by admin at the class page for each day.

* Reserve
---------
"Reserve" is now a command in the user navigation menu,
(if you are a student) next to "Edit Profile". Try to reserve
some classes and then see your reservation on the class page
for that day.

* Confirm
---------
"Confirm" is now a command in the user navigation menu,
(if you are a teacher). Teachers that have not yet confirm their
classes appear with a questionmark (?) next to their name at
that specific class. Teachers that have confirmed their classes
appear with an ok-mark (O). This will be restricted for admin
to see in the final version, but for the time being, available
for all beta-testers.
